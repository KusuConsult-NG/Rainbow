--
-- ONE PART OF scripts/apply_all_migrations.sql — generated, do not edit by hand.
--   Regenerate with: python3 scripts/build_apply_in_parts.py
--
-- Run the parts IN NUMBER ORDER, each on its own, letting each finish before the
-- next. The order is not cosmetic: part 02 drops the permissive policy set BY
-- NAME, and several later parts assume columns an earlier part adds.
--
-- Expect `NOTICE: skipping ...` lines — they are the guards that let these files
-- run against a database that does not have a given table yet.
--
-- ONE PART BEHAVES DIFFERENTLY IF YOU RUN IT TWICE. Part 02, the RLS policy
-- migration, is ATOMIC rather than idempotent: it drops the old policy set by
-- name and creates a new one inside its own BEGIN/COMMIT. Run it a second time
-- and it says
--
--     ERROR: policy "profiles_select_self_or_staff" for table "profiles"
--            already exists
--
-- and rolls itself back. That message means THE POLICIES ARE ALREADY IN PLACE.
-- Nothing is half-applied, and part 15 will still report every row PASS. If you
-- are unsure whether a part landed, run part 15 — it writes nothing and tells
-- you the truth about the whole set.
--
-- The LAST part writes nothing. It returns one row per thing that had to be
-- true, and every one of them must read PASS.
--
-- If you can paste the whole of apply_all_migrations.sql in one go, do that
-- instead: one paste cannot be run out of order or stopped halfway by accident.

-- ============================================================================
-- OPERATION RAINBOW — A SIGNUP MAY NOT CHOOSE ITS OWN ROLE
--
-- THE HOLE
--
-- `handle_new_user()` has, since the initial schema, created the profile like
-- this:
--
--     role := COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'role', 'CITIZEN')
--
-- `raw_user_meta_data` is `options.data` from `supabase.auth.signUp`, written
-- by whoever is signing up, with the anon key — which ships inside the APK and
-- inside the browser bundle, by design, because row-level security is meant to
-- be the whole access model.
--
-- So this was enough to become a commander:
--
--     supabase.auth.signUp({
--       email, password,
--       options: { data: { role: 'HQ_COMMAND' } },
--     })
--
-- and `is_command()` / `is_staff()` read `profiles.role`, so that account then
-- passes every policy in the RLS migration: the full incident board, live
-- telemetry for every citizen who has pressed SOS, dispatch, escalation, mass
-- broadcast to the whole state.
--
-- WHY THE EXISTING GUARD DID NOT COVER IT
--
-- `profiles_no_privilege_escalation` is BEFORE UPDATE. The escalation is not an
-- update — the role is chosen at INSERT, by the signup itself. README.md said
-- "nothing reads user_metadata", which was true of the policies and not true of
-- the trigger that creates the row the policies read.
--
-- THE FIX
--
-- Signup no longer reads `role` at all. Every account created through the
-- public auth endpoint is a CITIZEN, whatever it asks for, and `full_name` and
-- `phone` are still honoured because they are not privileges.
--
-- Staff are provisioned by a privileged caller instead: create the account,
-- then set `profiles.role` with the service key. That path is unaffected — the
-- UPDATE guard already exempts `service_role` — and it is what
-- `/api/admin/provision` now does. The console's "Provision Security Personnel
-- Account" form used to rely on the hole: it passed the chosen role in
-- `options.data` and the trigger obligingly applied it.
--
-- A NOTE ON WHAT IS NOT DONE HERE
--
-- Existing profiles are left alone. This migration cannot tell an account that
-- was legitimately provisioned as HQ_COMMAND from one that asked to be. That
-- audit is in E2E_AUDIT_REPORT.md as an operational step, with the query for
-- it, because it needs a human who knows who is supposed to be staff.
--
-- Idempotent: safe to re-run.
